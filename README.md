# health_keysearch_analysis
"Web is our home doctor": Analysis on how people per countries use the web for their health concerns. 

ANALYSIS CASE:
When we believe that our health is not at its best, we dash to search on the internet for what this might be.
Words that are probably used to describe these searches are 'diseases', 'diagnosis', 'prevention', 'symptoms', 'treatment'.
Which of them is the most popular?
Are those words actually related?
Which countries google them most? 
Do people in specific countries get worried and try to find ways to cure themselves very late and post facto?
Which countries care most about prevention? 
These are some of the questions that this data analysis answers and explains.
